# react-todo-test
This is a simple react todo app with a PostgreSQL database. I will write down all the problems I enountered working on this project here.

## time spent
* roughly 8-10 hours
* spent quite some time setting up the environment (had to use vpn in China)

## issues I faced:
* on submitting a form, is it prefered to use "onClick" on a button or "onSubmit" on the whole form?
* use a tag or link from react-router-dom, which one is preferrable?
* the delete all implementation is less than ideal, I did it by deleting individual items one by one, not sure if i can delete multple items at once.
* There are still some warning but can't figure out why.
