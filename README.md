# react-todo-test
This is a simple react todo app with a PostgreSQL database. I will write down all the problems I enountered working on this project here.

issues I faced:
* on submitting a form, is it prefered to use "onClick" on a button or "onSubmit" on the whole form?
* use a tag or link from react-router-dom, which one is preferrable?
* There are still some warning but can't figure out why.
